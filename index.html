            <h3>COACHING TECHNIQUE</h3>
            <br>
            <p>I’ve honed my coaching technique over the decades. I aim to communicate openly and clearly, addressing critical points and providing continuous, constructive feedback.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="body_right">
            <h3>GOALS</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                The process starts with clearly defined objectives. How will you know how to change if you don’t know what needs changing. We’ll develop your goals in conversation together.
            </p>

            <h3>GROWTH</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                The growth stage is the meat in the sandwich. It is here that you put new strategies to work, and begin addressing the issues that have been holding you back.
            </p>

            <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                At this point in the process I ask you to reflect on the changes you’ve made, and whether you’re satisfied with there the results have led you. After this, we can address sustainability.
